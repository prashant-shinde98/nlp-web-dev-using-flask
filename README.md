# Flask Web Development Project

Welcome to my **Flask Web Development Project**! 🚀

This project showcases a web application built using **Flask** that integrates key features: **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**, **Sentiment Analysis**, **Text Summarization**, and user **Login/Register** functionality. The application is designed with user-friendly HTML pages, allowing users to interact seamlessly with the features.

## 📚 Features

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extracts and highlights named entities from user-inputted text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of the text (positive, negative, neutral) and displays the results.
- **Text Summarization**: Condenses long passages of text into concise summaries.
- **Login and Registration**: Allows users to create accounts, log in, and access personalized features.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive HTML pages to enhance user experience and showcase results effectively.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**: Main programming language for backend logic.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the web application.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **Libraries**: 
  - `nlpcloud`, or other relevant libraries for NER and sentiment analysis.
  - Any summarization libraries you may be using.
  - `Flask-Login` for handling user authentication.
